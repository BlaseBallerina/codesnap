## Metadata
The meta data section between the '---' lines above won't be published to the body of your post. It accepts special 
metadata fields, including:

1. "title:" This is the title of your post

Any metadata fields other than those listed above will be ignored.

## Markdown
The body of your post can accept any markdown content. If you are unfamiliar with markdown syntax, check out this 
[Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#images)

## Images
If you would like to include images in your posts, you can reference the image URL in one of two ways:

1. Link to images on the web using the absolute path (e.g. "http://www.example.com/myImg.jpg")
1. Add images to the images folder of your repo and reference them using the relative 'images' path (e.g. 
"images/myImg.jpg")
